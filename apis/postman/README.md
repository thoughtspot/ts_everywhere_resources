# ThoughtSpot-Postman
A Postman collection of API endpoints for the ThoughtSpot Platform. 

These endpoints rely on three global variables to be set up in your Postman environment

- domain: The url of your ThoughtSpot cloud instance. For trial instances, this should be https://try.thoughtspot.cloud/callosum/v1
- username: the username you signed up for with ThoughtSpot
- password: the password you signed up for with ThoughtSpot

## How to use
Download the json file in this repo, then within Postman navigate to *collections > import* and select the json file.
