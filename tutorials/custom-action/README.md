# Custom Action Tutorial

This folder contains the code for the custom actions tutorial.  You can run the tutorial by replacing the tse.js file
with /backups/tse-final.js and running from a web server.  

Python3 provides a simple web server by running `python3 -m http.server <port>` from the folder with `index.html`.  
You can then browse to `http://localhost:<port>` in a web browser.
