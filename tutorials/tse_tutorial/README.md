# TSE Tutorial

This folder contains the files used for the ThoughtSpot Everywhere introductory tutorial.  You can sign up for the 
hands-on training on the
[ThoughtSpot training site](https://training.thoughtspot.com/thoughtspot-everywhere-for-developers).  If you 
prefer to look at the code, you can get the final code from the /backups folder.  You can copy tse-final.js to 
replace the tse.js file.  

To run the code, you can use any standard web host.  For training we use Python3 (python3 -m http.server 8000).
